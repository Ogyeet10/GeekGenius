If this makes enough money, I will fully update the video player to look amazing, but this requires money and for this to be sustainable I have to know how much I will make to be able to accurately judge how much money I can put into this non-essential feature.
                Text("GeekGenius is a project by me (Aidan Leuenberger) for my friends, family, and classmates. This app allows you to not only view and watch content made by me (and hopefully other classmates) to your heart's content but also interact with me and other users in the comments section. I hope you’ll have as much fun as I did making it. Also, I will be actively updating this app so expect an update every 1-2 weeks. Content will be pushed every weekend or so I might forget sometimes. I will make content over the summer, just less often. Finally, I want to dedicate this app to these people:")
